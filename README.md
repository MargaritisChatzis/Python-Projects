# Python-Projects
 
 These are projects written in Python during my master courses at the University of Athens. Below is a short description of each project.

+ Projects for the course "Basic Topics in Astrophysics" : 1

 - Monte Carlo simulation
    
    The goal here is to study the beheavior of photons escaing from a 2D proton cloud under various simplifications. 
    More information can be found in the short report accompanying the code.

+ Projects for the course "Computational Astrophysics" : 5
 Some minor code snippets have been adapted from the lectures.

 - Projecting a Galaxy to higher redshift

    Aim of this project is to take the image of a close galaxy, here NGC3982 with a redshift of z=0.00371, and project it to z=3.
    To do this we need to resize and dimm the image appropiately. 

 - Spectral fitting of galaxy nucleus with lmfit

    The aim here is to do a spectral fitting on the HÎ± and NII lines of the nucleus of NGC1266. 
    To do this we first remove the continuum from the data and then use lmfit to simultaneously fit 3 Gaussians.

 - Random Walk

    Our aim is to visually represent the difference between a one, two, and three dimesnional random walk.

 - Bayesian fitting with Ultranest
    
    The purpose of this project is to familiarise ourselves with the usage of various fitting methods using greybody data as an example and use Ultranest to produce similiar results and compare them.

 - Creating a Luminosity Function

    Creating a luminosity function for the 5MUSES dataset (obtained by DOI:10.1088/0004-637X/723/1/895) showcasing the importance of correcting the detection volume.
